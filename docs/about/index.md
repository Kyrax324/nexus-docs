# What is Nexus Ecosystem?

The `Nexus Ecosystem` is the result of `Project Nexus`, which aims to establish a standardized solution that covers the entire project flow from development to deployment.
It's designed to produce quality, reliable, and maintainable projects, while improving collaboration and efficiency across the team.

## Ideology

### Why Standardization is important ?

Standardization is important in software companies for several reasons:

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Consistency | Standardization leads to consistent code and processes across the team, improving quality and reducing errors. |
| Collaboration | Standardization enables developers to collaborate more efficiently by providing a common language and set of conventions. |
| Efficiency | Standardization saves time and effort by eliminating the need for developers to research best practices or figure out how to perform a task. |
| Scalability | Standardization makes it easier to onboard new employees, integrate new technologies, and maintain consistent processes as the company grows. |
