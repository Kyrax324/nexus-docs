# Nexus Book: Standardization & Best Practices

The `Nexus Book` is a comprehensive guide to the standardization and best practices used in the Nexus Ecosystem.

## Fundamental Principles

To achieve these goals, the Nexus Book emphasizes three fundamental principles of software development that should be considered throughout the project life cycle:

- `Readability`: Code should be easy to read, understand, and follow.
- `Maintainability`: Code should be easy to modify, fix, and update as needed.
- `Scalability`: Code should be able to handle increasing amounts of data or users without significant performance issues.
